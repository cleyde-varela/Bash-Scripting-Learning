# :computer: Bash-Scripting-Learning
A repository to document my steps into improving my Bash Scripting skills.

This repository contains my Bash Scripting practice projects and notes, created while learning and exploring.

## :mag: Topics Covered So Far

## :calendar: Future projects


## :clipboard: Heads up
The notes look a little messy for now since I'm writing things down as I learn.  
Iâ€™ll clean everything up and make it more friendly soon! ;)
